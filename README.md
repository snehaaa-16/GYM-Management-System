# Gym Management System

**Cleaned repository** for the Gym Management System project.

## What's included
- `src/gymmanagement/` — Java source files (only `.java` files; compiled classes removed)
- `uml/` — UML diagrams from the original project
- `.gitignore` — Clean ignore rules
- `build.xml` — (if present, copied from original)

## How to run
1. Import the project in IntelliJ IDEA as a plain Java project.
2. Ensure a JDK (Java 8+) is configured.
3. Build / compile the project:
   - From IntelliJ: Build -> Build Project
   - Or with Ant if `build.xml` is present: `ant` (requires Ant)
4. Run the main class (e.g., `gymmanagement.AdminFront` or other entry point).

## Notes & recommendations
- This repo **does not** include compiled `.class` files or IDE files.
- If you use Maven/Gradle, consider converting the project for easier build and dependency management.
- Add instructions here if your project depends on a database or external files.
